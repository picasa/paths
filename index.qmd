I am using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programming language to write algorithms that generate digital images. It's very much like swaying a tool originally made for statistical analysis and quantitative display of information for artistic endeavors.  
I'm curious how creative coding, by reducing the time between implementing changes and observing their effects, can develop intuition for making visual art.

My work involves altering existing datasets, treating them as malleable materials to craft diverse visual representations, from figurative to abstract interpretations of natural subjects.  
Rather than digital printing, I am interested in using a pen-plotter to draw my work on paper. Somehow, I assume that the constraints imposed by this machine are a nice frame to the flexibility of code.
