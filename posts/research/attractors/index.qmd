> ### Aesthetic point sets generated by discrete dynamical systems.

This work explores the capacity of discrete dynamical systems to generate a large diversity of point sets. It is based on this [paper](https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper203.pdf) from J.C Sprott in 1993, recently [reproduced](http://paulbourke.net/fractals/sprott/) by Paul Bourke. Henrik Lindberg also [published](https://blog.k2h.se/post/hunting-for-attractors/) an R implementation of the quadratic map functions used here. 

The algorithm is based on a system of difference equations, with 12 parameters. The first step is to sample the parameter space by using a discrete scale of 26 values for each parameter so that each sample can be assigned a "name" with 12 letters. A second step discards failed solutions (convergence to a point, divergence) and filters the aesthetic ones, based on a set of criteria (Lyapunov exponent, summary of point density distribution, correlation). Overall, very few solutions are selected (~ 0.1 %).

While this method is a very good generator for diverse 2D shapes, it is not compatible with pen-plotting because of the difficulty to create paths from those point sets - the points are not ordered by the iterations of the difference equation, and jumps from one position to another. One solution is to define the relative neighbourhood [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_neighborhood_graph) on a subsample of the simulated set of points.
