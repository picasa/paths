> ### Cellular-like features generated from tessellation of point sets.

This algorithm first generates a point set, using either a deterministic (ODE) or stochastic method. Then, a space tessellation method is used on a subset of the original point set. This method is used for different features loosely inspired by cellular biology (e.g. cells, tissues, vessels), that are assembled as different layers.

The aim was to search for a balance between the algorithm capacity to generate various outputs (but needing a curation step) and its capacity to produce aesthetic but overly similar outputs (narrow parameterization). This solution also explored the variability generated by sampling the same initial point set at different scales and locations. This last idea was adapted to the sampling of various topographical locations in the [dispyr](/posts/works/dispyr/index.qmd) series.
