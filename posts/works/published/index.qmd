#### 2023-01, Collective exhibition, digital and physical works

In this collection of landscape representations, I used real elevation data produced by various public institutes to create digital representations of the Pyrénées mountain range. I selected pieces moving from realism to abstraction while staying in the landscape figurative style, a way to acknowledge mountains as scientific and mystic places.

Theses works were selected and presented during a collective exhibition ([*Odysseys*](https://verse.works/exhibitions/odysseys-pierre-casadebaig)) in January 2023, at [Cromwell Place](https://www.cromwellplace.com/), London.

#### 2022-09, Collective exhibition, digital work

One work playing on the data-to-ink ratio idea from data visualisation, a quick way to say that you should avoid using too much ink if it does not represent information. In this case, a bit less than 2 percent of the initial topographical information is represented in this landscape. This work (Conflated Conflent) was selected for an online collective exhibition ([*Arithmetic Phenomena*](https://verse.works/exhibitions/arithmetic-phenomena), verse.com).

#### 2022-09, Dispyr studies, digital works

An attempt to emulate etching aesthetics with code, methodically removing more and more information.

#### 2022-07, Ridge planting, digital and physical works

Collaboration with Anthony Siracusa. This short series is an attempt to gradually move from code-generated to hand-drawn works. In a first step we generated about a hundred simple landscapes, using geographical data from the Alps mountain range. We then selected a dozen outputs, traced them using a pen-plotter, made a final selection and finally drawn plant shapes between the ridges.

#### 2022-07, Dispyr 8 Views, digital and physical works

Selected fragments of the Pyrénées mountain range, based on real-world data from a digital elevation model (15x10 km region). The overall aesthetic is obtained by adding noise and discarding data as a function of a distance matrix.

#### 2022-01, Dispyr, digital and physical works

A series of 16 curated iterations representing random fragments of the Pyrénées mountain range, based on real-world data from a digital elevation model.
The overall aesthetic is obtained by adding noise and discarding data as a function of various attributes (elevation, slope, elevation dispersion). About 90 % of the information present in the initial dataset is discarded, using four methods.
