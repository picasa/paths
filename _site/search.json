    "text": "Inspiration and aims\nI was searching for an hybrid between the simplicity and efficiency of a famous data visualization in astronomy and the Meridian series by Matt Deslauriers. Moreover, to be able to use a pen-plotter to trace the images on paper, the algorithm should produce relatively long lines rather than the myriad of short segments that make Meridian appealing.\n \n\nleft : “Successive pulses from the first pulsar discovered, CP 1919, are here superimposed vertically. The pulses occur every 1.337 seconds. They are caused by rapidly spinning neutron star.” From The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy.right : Meridian #638\n\nThis algorithm feeds on elevation data produced by public structures with different technologies (image analysis, topographical radar, or lidar) and made available for reuse. In this sense, it differs from generative art, where the code is self-sufficient to produce results (see why-love-generative-art) This short article explains the underlying logic and software code. A basic reproducible example is available here to encourage creative experiments.\nI won’t comment much on the choice of the R language and the code itself. It’s just that I knew this language for work, and I was curious to see if i could reuse it for other projects. For me, the functional programming paradigm makes sense to interact with code, moreover when working in interrupted streaks. The broad data exploration workflow resonate with my somewhat reductionist creative approach, especially how the tools for data visualization enable to focus on visual experiments rather code for graphics. I also went for the easy way, thanks to the creators of incredible libraries for (spatial) data processing and graphics. For this project I used {{stars}}, {{dplyr}}, and {{ggplot2}}.\nThe algorithm is composed by three main functions, created to be used successively (with the R pipe function, |&gt;).

    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\nFeatures generation\nThe outputs have only two broad features: a random location in the Pyrénées mountain range and a rendering style, randomly chosen among four methods with a set of probabilities. Most of the visual variability in the outputs is driven by the choice of geographical location, it gives the series a strong link with the subject, but somehow limits the maximum number of obtainable iterations.\nLocation\nTo get a random location in the Pyrénées mountain range, we first define a sampling region (a 20 km wide buffer around the French-Spain border), and use sf::st_sample to sample a location in this polygon. The code is simplified to sample a mysterious location in a polygon defined by the Andorra borders.\n\nCode# load a polygon of the Andorra borders\npolygon &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(\n  country = c(\"andorra\"), scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\"\n  ) |&gt; st_transform(2154)\n\n# get a sample in the defined polygon \ncoord &lt;- st_sample(polygon, size = 1) |&gt; st_as_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRendering style\nThe overall rendering style is impacted by a dozen parameters in the code (e.g. line density, position of lines in the y-axis, amount and position of removed data). Rather than a free exploration of this parameter space, which could lead to heterogeneous outputs, I defined a limited number of fixed sets of parameters. I created four styles, and named them as weather conditions (clear, mist, snow, storm).\nTechnically nothing complicated, the get_features_ridge() function returns a list of features and associated parameters, later used for the data processing step. The parameters are presented at the moment they are used in the code.\nData processing\nThis stage uses the previous set of features to download and process data from a digital elevation model (3D) into a set of lines (2D), with distinct processing steps.\nGetting a realistic description of the landscape\nThis step start by actually retrieving the elevation data around the sampled location (a 2x2 km square for the illustration, 20x15 km normally). The {{elevatr}} R package makes this step a breeze, but the process is the same when using local high-resolution data.\n\nCode# get DEM data in a 2x2 km region around the sampled point\ndem &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(\n  coord, z = 11, expand = 1E3, clip = \"bbox\") \n\n# use a heatmap to glance at elevation data\nplot &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_stars(data = st_as_stars(dem)) +\n  geom_sf(data = coord, color = \"white\", size = 1) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"elevation\") +\n  labs(x = \"lon\", y = \"lat\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlicing the landscape into lines\nThe aim is to process a 3D point set into 2D lines, by computing multiple lines of elevation as a function of longitude, for discrete latitude values. This step is perfectly illustrated by the stacked plot of radio signals presented previously. In our case, each line corresponds to one row in the elevation data (74x74 matrix in the example). Without further modifications, the output is unclear, with a lot of intersecting lines (figure A).\nTo improve the output readability, but also introduce potential for variations, we process this raw elevation matrix with two actions:\n\nshift lines in the y-direction as a function of their rank from the foreground.\ndelete the line segments that should be hidden by foreground lines with a higher elevation.\n\n\nCode# parameters\nz_shift = 5\n\n# convert DEM from spatial to dataframe format\ndf_dem &lt;- dem |&gt; stars::st_as_stars() |&gt;\n  as_tibble() |&gt; select(x, y, z = 3)  \n\n# compute elevation shift as a function of normalized distance\ndata_index &lt;- df_dem |&gt;\n  distinct(y) |&gt; arrange(y) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    y_rank = rank(y),\n    y_dist = scales::rescale(y, to = c(0,1)),\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(dz = y_rank * z_shift)\n\n# compute shifted elevation values\ndf_shift &lt;- df_dem |&gt; \n  left_join(data_index, by = \"y\") |&gt;\n  group_by(y) |&gt; mutate(xn = x - min(x), x_rank = rank(x)) |&gt; ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(zs = z + dz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shifting step calculates the difference from the reference elevation as a linear function of its rank from the foreground (figure B). Increasing the slope of this function impacts the perspective, towards a more aerial view of the landscape, eventually reducing the number of intersecting lines (figure C). Using non-linear functions creates unrealistic but interesting perspectives.\nAt this step, a fast solution to achieve line intersection is by drawing lines with a filled area underneath, starting from the background and thus progressively masking previous polygons (as in painter’s algorithm). This solution is implemented directly in the ggridges R package. But this option is not ideal for creative coding : the hidden lines still exist, which makes vector outputs unusable with a pen-plotter, and it lacks flexibility on the overlaying method.\n\nCode# parameters\nn_lag = 100\nz_threshold = 0\n\n# define window functions for multiple lag positions\nlist_distance &lt;- map(glue::glue(\"~ . - lag(., n = {1:n_lag})\"), ~ as.formula(.))\nlist_col &lt;- glue::glue(\"zs_{1:n_lag}\")\n\n# remove points hidden by foreground ridges :\n# compute lagged elevation difference between successive y for each x \n# replace value by NA when the difference is less than a threshold \ndf_ridge &lt;- df_shift |&gt; \n  arrange(y_rank) |&gt; group_by(x) |&gt;\n  mutate(across(zs, .fns = list_distance)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    zn = case_when(\n      if_any(all_of(list_col), ~ . &lt; z_threshold) ~ NA_real_,\n      TRUE ~ zs)) |&gt;\n  select(- all_of(list_col))\n\n\nIn the code above, the intersections between lines are avoided by checking for a minimum distance between a point at a given x position and its neighbourhood along y, and removing the point if any points in the neighbourhood falls below this distance (z_threshold parameter). To avoid computing the distance matrix for all points (744, in this small area), we only check for intersections along a limited range (n_lag parameter, between 0 and 300 y ranks). Increasing the threshold parameter creates clearer distinction between the sides of mountains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine segments are hidden by foreground lines by using polygon masking (left) or distance-based point removal with a null (center) or positive threshold (right).\n\n\n\nEffect of shift (in rows) and threshold (in columns) parameter combination on the landscape rendering (16 km2).\n\nAltering the lines with noise and deletion\nFinally, the overall aesthetic is obtained by adding noise and discarding data as a function of various attributes (elevation, slope, elevation dispersion). The governing idea was to test how our perception of the landscape changes when most of the initial topographical data is perturbed or removed. Here are four methods, but much is left to explore. The illustration code here is functioning without external call, but highly redundant and surely not optimal, you can conveniently hide it if you feel horrified.\n\n\nFour data processing methods, all based on filtering points and adding noise, and named after weather conditions (clear, mist, snow, storm).\n\nclear\nFor each ridgeline, the method samples 50 % of the points and adds moderate jitter on elevation values.\n\nCode# parameters\nz_remove = 0.5      # proportion of points to remove\nz_jitter = 4        # amount of jitter in elevation values\n\n# randomly sample a proportion of points in a line, jitter their y-position.\ndf_plot &lt;- df_ridge |&gt;\n  group_by(y_rank) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(prop = (1 - z_remove)) |&gt;\n  mutate(zn = jitter(zn, amount = z_jitter))\n\n# plot output\ndf_plot |&gt; ggplot(aes(x, zn, group = y)) +\n  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) + coord_fixed() + theme_void() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmist\nSame base as the previous method.

    "text": "Aesthetic point sets generated by discrete dynamical systems.\n\nThis work explores the capacity of discrete dynamical systems to generate a large diversity of point sets. It is based on this paper from J.C Sprott in 1993, recently reproduced by Paul Bourke. Henrik Lindberg also published an R implementation of the quadratic map functions used here.\nThe algorithm is based on a system of difference equations, with 12 parameters. The first step is to sample the parameter space by using a discrete scale of 26 values for each parameter so that each sample can be assigned a “name” with 12 letters. A second step discards failed solutions (convergence to a point, divergence) and filters the aesthetic ones, based on a set of criteria (Lyapunov exponent, summary of point density distribution, correlation). Overall, very few solutions are selected (~ 0.1 %).\nWhile this method is a very good generator for diverse 2D shapes, it is not compatible with pen-plotting because of the difficulty to create paths from those point sets - the points are not ordered by the iterations of the difference equation, and jumps from one position to another. One solution is to define the relative neighbourhood graph on a subsample of the simulated set of points."

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) represents elevation as a function of latitude and longitude. In France, the national geographic institute makes this DEM available in Open-Data (RGE, up to a 1m resolution). These illustrations are made of multiple lines of elevation as a function of longitude, for discrete latitude values. Overplotting is avoided (hidden lines) by checking for a minimal distance between two lines. Variation comes from the scale and location of the geographical region and from the parameterization of the line clipping method.\nAdding noise or removing information from the original DEM data seems to create a more natural rendering.

In his algorithm, individual shapes (glyphs) are generated with splines defined by few control points sampled from a 2D space (square, ellipse), and glyphs are concatenated together to create cursive-like writing.\nHere, to produce words or paragraphs with sensible text-like aesthetics, I limited the number of generated glyphs and mapped them to a fixed set of characters: the represented glyph sequence is a function of a generated text (e.g. Lorem ipsum).\nVariation can be obtained by acting on the glyph aggregation method. If the glyphs are drawn independently from each other, the algorithm emulates script writing. More detailed symbols can be obtained by concatenating a few glyphs (2-4) before mapping them to characters. Increasing the number of spline control points also produces refined shapes, but quickly becomes too complex. The examples below are using two random seeds: one for the character set, and one for the text sequence used as layout."

This solution also explored the variability generated by sampling the same initial point set at different scales and locations. This last idea was adapted to the sampling of various topographical locations in the dispyr series."

Multiple curves are computed to constitute a node, and multiple nodes to constitute a stem / individual. Further recursion can be used to create populations of multiple individuals, with random or community-dependent features.\nThe main random elements are the initial value of the sequence, and the angle distribution between curve segments.\nI explained this approach a bit more in details during a talk at an art show, slides are available here.\nOn this series, rather than properly computing hidden line or polygons, I used an external algorithm (bitmap tracing) which had the nice side-effect of reshaping and merging some paths."

But rather than aiming for a realistic rendering, the algorithm was adjusted to evoke hand-drawn landscapes. While some outputs were clearly standing out and could stand on a page by themselves, most of them would lack representativeness. Instead of discarding them, i designed rules to assemble these modest outputs, leading to the creation of synthetic yet realistic landscapes.\nThis project also harmonized distinct algorithmic systems—such as ridges, writings, and clouds—via a responsive grid layout, adapting to the shape of generated components.\nOn the physical side, the project also explored alternatives to precise and technical pen-plotter renderings.

    "text": "Methods\nLandscape generation\nWe start with high-resolution (5x5 m cells) data from a digital elevation model (DEM, here IGN RGE Alti 5m) that represents the variations in land height in South-West France. Using the dispyr algorithm, this 3D data is transformed into a series of lines that we call “elevation profiles”. For each iteration, these lines can represent anything from a single horizon to a series of layered ridges, depending on where the data is sampled and how it’s oriented (two random parameters). I settled for a simulation set of 3000 individual profiles, whose diversity is illustrated below.\nClassification of profiles types\nWorking with this library of about 3000 profiles, we discard the less interesting ones and classify the remaining into two categories: flat ones that look like fields or plains, and tall ones that resemble mountains or high hills. To create and imaginary piece of landscape, we select a random mixture of profiles — most are flat, but few are tall — and layer them accordingly.\nAssembly rules\nDistinct aesthetics\nThe different landscapes generated by this process are organized into a catalog. Each page of the catalog is divided into different sections, or “cells”, by a generative grid system. Each cell might contain a part of a landscape, a cloud, or even texts that look like writing but don’t have a specific meaning. A grid system helps us divide the page space into different sized sections, both regular and irregular proportions. We do this by splitting the space into fractions, with each division being a one-sixth multiple. At the end, we designed four page styles ranging from full-page landscapes with different physical rendering (ink brush, technical ink pen) to figure-like gridded layouts with or without legend.\nbrush\ncloud\nfigure\ngrids\nRendering\nEach style was rendered on paper (Canson mixed media, natural white, fine grain, 200 gsm) with a different set of pens :\n\nbrush pen (Pentel FL2B, black ink): ridges in the brush design.\ncalligraphy fountain pen (Lamy Joy 1.5 mm): glyphs in the brush design (Sailor Shikiori Yodaki red ink) and in the cloud design (Pilot Iroshizuku take-sumi neutral black ink).\ncalligraphy pens (Pilot Parallel): hatched cloud in the cloud design (3.8 mm, Pilot Iroshizuku fuyu-syogun medium gray ink), bold writings in the figure design (1.5 mm, Pilot black ink).\ntechnical pens (Rotring Isograph): ridges in the cloud, figure, and grids designs (0.3 mm), frames in the figure and grids style (0.8 mm), and writings in the figure style (0.3 mm), all were draw with the Pilot Iroshizuku take-sumi ink."
